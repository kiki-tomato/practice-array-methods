Julia and Kate are doing a study on dogs. So each of them asked 5 dog owners about their dog's age, and stored the data into an array (one array for each). For now, they are just interested in knowing whether a dog is an adult or a puppy. A dog is an adult if it is at least 3 years old, and it's a puppy if it's less than 3 years old.

Create a function 'checkDogs', which accepts 2 arrays of dog's ages ('dogsJulia' and 'dogsKate'), and does the following things:

//   dogs.forEach(function (age, i) {

//       : console.log(`Dog number ${i + 1} is still a puppy üê∂`);
//   });
// };

//we can start writing code in the global context, but it's not a good practice. it's best to create a function

// const juliaData = [3, 5, 2, 12, 7];
// juliaData.slice(1, 4);

// 2. Create an array with both Julia's (corrected) and Kate's data
// const kateData = [4, 1, 15, 8, 3];
// const juliaDataNew = juliaData.slice(1, 4);
// const allData = juliaDataNew.concat(kateData);

// 3. For each remaining dog, log to the console whether it's an adult ("Dog number 1 is an adult, and is 5 years old") or a puppy ("Dog number 2 is still a puppy üê∂")
